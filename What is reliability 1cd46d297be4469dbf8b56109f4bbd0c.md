# What is reliability engineering?

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Reliability engineering is first and foremost the application of good engineering, in the widest sense, during design, development, manufacture and service

</aside>

- Reliability - **The probability** that an item will **perform a required function without failures** **under stated conditions** **for a stated period of time**.
    - A time-based/dependent concept of quality
    - Expressed as failures in the time domain
    - An aspect of engineering uncertainty
- Durability - The ability of an item to withstand the efforts of time/cycle/distance dependent mechanisms (e.g. fatigue, wear, corrosion, electrical parameter change)
    - Expressed as the minimum time before wearout failures - related to TTF
- Objective of reliability engineering (in the order of priority)
    - To prevent or reduce the likelihood/frequency of failures
    - To identify and correct the cause of failures
    - If cannot correct, cope with failures
    - Estimate the likely reliability of new designs
- Primary skills
    - The ability to understand and anticipate the possible causes of failures, and knowledge to prevent them
    - Analyzing designs and data
        - Math and statistics can be used for quantifying reliability
        - But in practice, the uncertainty is often in orders of magnitude.
        - So, engineering should take precedence in determining the cause of problems and their solutions.
    

## Why study reliability?

1. We study variation in materials, process, and application which cause the failures/unreliability of product, instead of the deterministic engineering knowledge. (Considering the most parameters of a product, mass, dimension, friction coefficients, strengths and stress, coefficient of thermal expansion, vary over time. )
2. We study statistics application in reliability field. Unlike the smooth application of math in insurance, market or agricultural experiments, it is harder to apply the math practically in reliability since we are meeting a greater degree of uncertainty.
3. We study the control of failure risks, which come from competition, the stress of schedule and deadline, the rapid evolution of materials, process and system, the safety concern and the need to reduce product cost - Traditional approach to quality management is hard to complete efficiently.
4. We study how to supplement good practice, to control the risk when the product team is overoptimistic or reluctant to point out the uncertainty.
